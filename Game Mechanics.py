                                          Wellbeing is about staying well in all areas of your life.
                        You can't affect your wellbeing score directly it's based on some other scores you have to think about:\n
                    > Fun score - this shows you how much fun you're having! You can raise your fun score by buying things to keep you 
                    busy such as books or video games, or by doing fun activities like meeting friends or playing football.
                    > Health score - a measure of how good your health is. Doing sports and getting exercise is good for your health. 
                    If you don't do this enough, or you eat unhealthy food, your health score will go down.
                    > Comfort score - this goes down whenever you do something that's hard work or a lot of effort, including exercise or 
                    cooking for yourself. But you can raise it with things that make life easier or more comfortable, such as a dishwasher 
                    or a winter coat.
                    > Satisfaction anything in the game that makes you feel good about yourself increases your satisfaction score. Giving 
                    money to charity, reading a book or doing some exercise will all increase your satisfaction levels.

                    got in the bank. Every week you must make THREE choices for each of these things: activities, food, and transport.

                    next week' button. Then your scores will change before the next turn starts. To win, you need to stay in the game for 
                    12 weeks. If you run out of money before then, or your wellbeing drops too low, it's game over! You need to make sure 
                    you always have enough money in the bank to pay all your bills. After 12 weeks, you can carry on playing if you like. 
                    Don't forget to read your messages every week for advice on how you're doing, updates on your spending, and other news. 
                    The Finance screen shows you all your fixed payments for the month, and a list of all your recent spending -- use it 
                    to plan how much you're going to spend.
